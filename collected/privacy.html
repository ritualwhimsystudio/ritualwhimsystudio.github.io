    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <div class="meta">Collected: Sticker Chart &middot; Last updated February 18, 2026</div>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Collected: Sticker Chart ("the App") is developed by Alyssa Wei ("we," "us," or "our"). We take your privacy seriously. This policy explains what data the App collects, how it is used, and your rights.</p>

    <h2>Data Collection</h2>

    <h3>Free Tier (Local-Only Mode)</h3>
    <p>When using the App without an account, all data is stored locally on your device. We do not collect, transmit, or store any personal information on external servers. Your charts, stickers, rewards, and settings remain entirely on your device.</p>
    <p>We do not collect:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Personal information (name, email, phone number)</li>
      <li>Location data</li>
      <li>Usage analytics or behavioral data</li>
      <li>Advertising identifiers</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Premium Tier (Account & Cloud Sync)</h3>
    <p>If you purchase the premium upgrade and choose to create an account:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Authentication:</strong> We use Apple Sign In to authenticate your account. We receive your Apple-provided user identifier and, only if you choose to share it, your name and email address.</li>
      <li><strong>Cloud Sync:</strong> Your app data (charts, stickers, rewards, and settings) is synced to our cloud service powered by Supabase to enable backup and multi-device sync. This data is stored securely and is associated with your account.</li>
      <li><strong>No additional tracking:</strong> Even with an account, we do not collect analytics, behavioral data, or advertising identifiers.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Product Catalog</h2>
    <p>The App fetches sticker pack information (names, images, prices) from our servers to display available content. This does not involve any personal data collection—it is simply retrieving the product catalog. Downloaded sticker images are cached locally on your device for offline use.</p>

    <h2>Crash Reporting</h2>
    <p>The App may collect anonymous crash reports to help us identify and fix bugs. Crash reports do not contain personally identifiable information.</p>

    <h2>In-App Purchases</h2>
    <p>Purchases are processed entirely by Apple through the App Store. We do not collect or store any payment information.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Apple Sign In:</strong> Used for account authentication (premium tier only). Subject to <a href="https://www.apple.com/privacy/">Apple's Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
      <li><strong>Supabase:</strong> Used for cloud data storage and sync (premium tier only). Subject to <a href="https://supabase.com/privacy">Supabase's Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
      <li><strong>RevenueCat:</strong> Used to manage in-app purchases. Subject to <a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy/">RevenueCat's Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Retention & Deletion</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Local data:</strong> All users can delete their local data (charts, stickers, rewards) from the App's settings at any time. This removes data from your device only.</li>
      <li><strong>Free tier:</strong> Deleting the App removes all data since everything is stored locally.</li>
      <li><strong>Premium tier:</strong> You can delete your account and all associated cloud data at any time from the App's settings. Upon account deletion, all data is permanently removed from our servers. Your App Store purchase history is retained by Apple and can be used to restore purchases on any device.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>The App does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. The free tier stores no data externally. The premium tier requires Apple Sign In, which is managed by the parent or guardian's Apple ID settings.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this policy from time to time. We will notify you of any material changes by updating the "Last updated" date above.</p>
